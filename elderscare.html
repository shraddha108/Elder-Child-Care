        <div class="tip">
            <h3>1. Open Communication</h3>
            <p>Regularly talk with your parents about their needs, preferences, and concerns. Encourage them to express their feelings and thoughts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>2. Educate Yourself</h3>
            <p>Learn about any medical conditions or challenges your parents face. This knowledge will help you provide better care and anticipate potential issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>3. Create a Safe Environment</h3>
            <p>Ensure their living space is safe and accessible. Remove tripping hazards, install grab bars in bathrooms, and ensure good lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>4. Stay Organized</h3>
            <p>Keep track of medical appointments, medications, and important documents. Use calendars, apps, or planners to stay on top of their schedule.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>5. Encourage Independence</h3>
            <p>Allow your parents to do as much as they can on their own. This helps maintain their dignity and sense of independence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>6. Build a Support Network</h3>
            <p>Don't try to do everything alone. Reach out to other family members, friends, or professional caregivers for help and support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>7. Take Care of Yourself</h3>
            <p>Caring for someone else can be exhausting. Make sure to take breaks, pursue your hobbies, and seek support if you feel overwhelmed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>8. Promote Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>Encourage regular exercise suitable for their age and health condition. Even light activities like walking can improve their physical and mental health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>9. Stay Connected</h3>
            <p>Help your parents stay socially active. Arrange visits with friends and family, or involve them in community activities or senior centers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>10. Plan for the Future</h3>
